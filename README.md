Selenium Conference 2016 - Selenium 3 Bug Bash
---------------------------------------
The Selenium Conference 2016 is hosting a Bug Bash http://bugbash.in/selenium-3 This github repository is the home for people who are participating in the Bug Bash; the project may live on after the conference and/or be combined with the master project at https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium

The aims of the Bug Bash extend beyond 'finding bugs', we are keen to encourage and foster collaborative work where we experiment with creating automated test suites for one or more of the kiwix applications. The conference has attracted several hundred passionate individuals; many have significant experience with the Selenium test automation framework. We also have several software testing gurus who are particpating in the Bug Bash and available to collaborate with the test automation to enhance the potency of the automated tests.

Participants can work individually and in groups. 

Suggested approaches include: 
   * Run your existing Selenium Tests against Selenium 3 build and report any issues.
   * Implementing automated tests for reporting bugs.
   * Reviewing and enhancing current open bugs from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues so they are easier to understand and fix
